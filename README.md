## Basic information
Software for wixel board to read glicemia values from Dexcom G4 Platinium and send them by UART1 (CGM). It is a part of myPancreas system (personal artificial pancreas). 

### Thanks
None of this would be possible without the extensive work of many others who have produced the open source tools upon which this builds directly.  There are too many to credit individually; thanks goes to everyone involved in xDrip and Nightscout.
